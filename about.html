            Welcome to my site.  I'm glad you found your way here.  
            I'm currently a student at Nashville sofware school.  
            Going back to school was a very recent decision, as I had just gotten laid off and wanted to try something different with my life.  
            Before coming to school, I worked in the mental health field with those struggling with drug addiction, trauma, and other behaviors that were harmful to people's lives.  
            I've always loved computers and working with others, so NSS was an easy decision for me!  
            One day in the future, I hope to be able to return to the mental health field and continue to serve the community from a developer point of view.
